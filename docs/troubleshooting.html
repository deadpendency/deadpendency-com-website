<h2 id="report-truncation"><a href="#report-truncation">Report Truncation</a></h2>

<p>
  The <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> report is a GitHub <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks#runs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check run</a>. The bulk of the report lives in the check run body, which has a (currently undocumented) limit of 65335 characters.
</p>

<p>
  When a repository has enough dependencies in some cases it will exceed this limit. In this scenario <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will remove non-key information from the report. Currently, this means that passing dependencies will no longer include links to the package registry or source repository.
</p>

<p>
  In some cases, this limited report will still exceed the maximum report size and will appear truncated.
</p>

<p>
  Longer term, the <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> report will be <a href="https://github.com/deadpendency/deadpendency/issues/36" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available external to GitHub</a> to avoid the problem entirely.
</p>

<h2 id="too-many-dependencies"><a href="#too-many-dependencies">Too Many Dependencies</a></h2>

<p>
  <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> makes a number of requests to external services, most notably GitHub. When a single repository has too many dependencies it is not possibly to reliably retrieve the dependency information without hitting rate limiting issues.
</p>
<p>
  As such <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will reject the request when a repository has over 500 unique dependencies.
</p>
