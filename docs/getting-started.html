<h2 id="installation"><a href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>
  Go to the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/deadpendency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadpendency app on GitHub marketplace</a> and install it. You can either install it for all repositories or for specific ones.
</p>

<p>
  It is recommended that you only install it on specific repositories that you wish to use Deadpenednecy on. Otherwise, Deadpendency will report an error if it cannot find dependencies in a repository without any dependency files.
</p>

<h2 id="how-deadpendency-works">How <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> Works</h2>

<p>
  Here is a quick high level overview of how <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> works.
</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Push a commit to your repository.</li>
    <li>The top 2 programming languages used in your repository are identified.</li>
    <li>The <a href="language-support">default dependency files</a> of these programming languages are read.</li>
    <li>Additional dependencies, or dependency files can be <a href="config#additional-dependency-files">loaded via config</a>.</li>
    <li>All found dependencies are assessed for project health.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/deadpendency/deadpendency-example/pull/1/checks">A report</a> is produced. The 'check' will fail if the dependencies are not healthy.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2 id="using-deadpendency">Using <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span></h2>

<p>
  Start by pushing a commit to your repository. It may be best to start with a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will run, producing <a href="https://github.com/deadpendency/deadpendency-example/pull/1/checks">a report</a>. There are a few possible results from the report.
</p>

<h3>No Dependencies Found</h3>

<p>This is due to either using a non-supported language, or more likely, your dependency files are in non-standard locations.</p>

<p>
  Refer to <a href="/docs/language-support">language support</a> for the default dependency files loaded. You may need to <a href="config#additional-dependency-files">configure additional dependency files</a> in the config.
</p>

<h3>The Check Passes üòä</h3>

<p>
  This indicates that all your dependencies are actively being maintained. <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will continue to monitor your dependencies as new commits are pushed. Nothing to do here.
</p>

<h3>The Check Passes with Warnings ü§í</h3>

<p>
  This indicates that some of your dependencies have health concerns. For example, there may be no commits within the last year.
</p>

<p>
  Warnings highlight dependencies that may become problematic in the future, but are not yet of concern. They can be reviewed at your discretion.
</p>

<p>
  Only failures should require your immediate attention, which is why the warnings still constitute a 'pass' of the check.
</p>

<h3 id="the-check-fails">The Check Fails üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>

<p>
  This indicates that some of your dependencies have serious health concerns. For example, they may have been flagged as deprecated.
</p>

<p>
  At this point you should review the failures. You then have a few options.
</p>

<h4>Ignore the failing dependencies</h4>

<p>
  Sometimes there is no choice but to depend on an inactive or unhealthy dependency. For example, there may be no viable alternatives.
</p>

<p>In this case it is recommended to <a href="config#ignore-dependencies">ignore the dependency</a> from being checked by <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span>.</p>

<h4>Adjust your failure thresholds</h4>

<p>
  Depending on your ecosystem, different failure thresholds for <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> may make sense. Or you may decide to disable (or set as a warning) some checks entirely.
</p>

<p>
  It is recommended that you <a href="config#configure-checks">tune the checks</a> so that failures are rare. Thus when they do happen, you know it is worth your attention to assess the dependency.
</p>

<h4>Switch to an alternative</h4>

<p>
  Ideally, if a dependency is no longer going to be well maintained, you should switch to an alternative that is well maintained. The most clear cut cases are when dependency X is deprecated in favor of dependency Y.
</p>

<h2 id="long-term-usage">Long Term Usage</h2>

<p>
  It is recommended to keep your <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> check passing, by ignoring or switching away from 'dead' dependencies.
</p>

<p>
  Then, as you work on your project and push commits, <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will monitor your dependency health. You can largely ignore the check until you see a new failure.
</p>
