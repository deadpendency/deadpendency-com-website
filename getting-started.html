<div class="faq-page">
<h1 class="mb-4"><span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id="installation"><a href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>
  Go to the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/deadpendency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadpendency app on GitHub marketplace</a> and install it. Select which repositories to install the GitHub app on.
</p>

<h2>How <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Push a commit to your repository. This could be a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a> (PR).</li>
  <li>The top 2 programming languages used in your repostiory are identified.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/language-support">default dependency files</a> of these programming languages are read.</li>
  <li>The dependencies are assessed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/deadpendency/deadpendency-example/pull/1/checks">A report</a> is produced. The 'check' will fail if the dependencies are not healthy.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span></h2>

<p>
  Start by pushing a commit to your repository. It may be best to start with a PR. <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will run, producing <a href="https://github.com/deadpendency/deadpendency-example/pull/1/checks">a report</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There are a few possible results from the report.
</p>

<h3>No Dependencies Found</h3>

<p>This is due to either using a non-supported language, or more likely, your dependency files are in non-standard locations.</p>

<p>
  Refer to <a href="/language-support">language support</a> for the default dependency files loaded. You may need to configure additional dependency files in the <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> config.
</p>

<h3>The Check Passes</h3>

<p>
  This indicates that all your dependencies are actively being maintained. <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will continue to monitor your dependencies as new commits are pushed. Nothing to do here.
</p>

<h3>The Check Passes with Warnings</h3>

<p>
  This indicates that some of your dependencies have health concerns. For example, there may be no commits within the last year.
</p>

<p>
  Warnings serve to provide a quick report on dependencies that may become problematic in the future. It is recommended you configure (LINK ME) your failure thresholds so that only when the check fails does it a mean a dependency is unhealthy enough that it should be reviewed.
</p>

<h3>The Check Fails</h3>

<p>
  This indicates that some of your dependencies have serious health concerns. For example, they may have been flagged as deprecated.
</p>

<p>
  At this point you should review the failures. You then have a few options.
</p>

<h4>Ignore the failing dependencies</h4>

<p>
  Sometimes there is no choice but to depend on an inactive or unhealthy dependency. For example, there may be no viable alternatives.
</p>

<p>In this case it is recommended to ignore the dependency (LINK ME) from being checked by deadpendency.</p>

<h4>Adjust your failure thresholds</h4>

<p>
  Depending on your ecosystem, different failure thresholds for <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> may make sense. Or you may decide to disable (or set as a warning) some checks entirely.
</p>

<p>
  It is recommended that you tune the checks so that when failures happen, the dependency is definitely unhealthy enough to consider switching away.
</p>

<h4>Switch to an alternative</h4>

<p>
  If a dependency is not actively maintained, then ideally you want to switch to a dependency which is.
</p>

<h2>Using <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> Long Term</h2>

<p>
  It is recommended to keep your <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> passing, by ignoring or switching away from 'dead' dependencies.
</p>

<p>
  Then, as you work on your project and push commits, <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> will monitor your dependency health. You can largely ignore the report until you see a new failure.
</p>
