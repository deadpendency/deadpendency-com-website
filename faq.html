<h1 class="mb-4"><span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white"></span>pendency</span> FAQ</h1>

<h4 class="text-info">What does <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white"></span>pendency</span> detect?</h3>
<p>It detects dependencies that have project health issues. For example is the dependency repository still actively being committed to.</p>

<h4 class="text-info">Does <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white"></span>pendency</span> failing a dependency mean I should stop using it?</h4>
<p>No! This is a call to action to review the dependency and make a decision as to whether to switch away or not.</p>
<p>In many cases it makes sense to keep using the dependency (eg. there are no viable alternatives). In this case, the dependency can be ignored from deadpendency checks.</p>

<h4 class="text-info">Why isn't Java supported?</h4>
<p>Maven does not provide the source repository of its packages.</p>

<h4 class="text-info">Why isn't Other language supported?</h4>
<p>Support is either not possible, planned, or the language is considered too niche. Feel free to create / upvote the relevant issue.</p>

<h4 class="text-info">Which package registries support structured deprecation?</h4>
<p>Currently NPM (JavaScript), Nuget (.NET) and Hackage (Haskell).</p>

<h4 class="text-info">Why isn't <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white"></span>pendency</span> available for private repositories?</h4>
<p>
  <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white"></span>pendency</span> is in beta. The focus is on improving and stablizing the system before making it available for purchase on private repositories.
</p>

<h4 class="text-info">How much will <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white"></span>pendency</span> cost for private repositories?</h4>
<p>
  To be determined. It should be cheap though.
