<h4>What does <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> detect?</h3>
<p>It detects dependencies that have project health issues. For example, is the dependencies' repository still actively being committed to.</p>

<h4>If a dependency is marked as unhealthy, should I stop using it?</h4>
<p>No! This is a call to action to review the dependency and make a decision as to whether to switch away or not.</p>
<p>In many cases it makes sense to keep using the dependency (eg. there are no viable alternatives). In this case, the dependency can be <a href="/docs/config#ignore-dependencies">ignored from <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> checks</a>.</p>

<h4>Why isn’t Other language supported?</h4>
<p>Support is either not possible, planned, or the language is considered too niche. Feel free to create / up vote the <a href="https://github.com/deadpendency/deadpendency/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alanguage-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant issue</a>.</p>

<h4>Which package registries support structured deprecation?</h4>
<p>Currently NPM (JavaScript), NuGet (.NET), Hackage (Haskell), Packagist (PHP) and Maven (Java / Kotlin / Scala).</p>

<h4>Does <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> support GitLab, Bitbucket, Other?</h4>
<p>
  No, <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> is currently a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/deadpendency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub.com app</a> and it can only analyze dependencies that are also hosted on GitHub.com.
</p>

<p>
  However, the <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> app will support GitLab and Bitbucket in the future, both in terms of an app and as hosts of dependency repositories.
</p>

<h4>Does <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> have an on-prem solution?</h4>
<p>
  No, not currently. This is eventually planned, but would come after supporting GitLab and Bitbucket as mentioned above.
</p>

<h4>Why isn’t <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> open source?</h4>
<p><span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> is not free for private organizations. However, as much <span class="text-warning">Dead</span><span class="text-white">pendency</span> code as possible will be open sourced.</p>
